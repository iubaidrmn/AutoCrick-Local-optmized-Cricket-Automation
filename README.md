1.	Problem Statement:
Our country has a lot of cricket talent, but most deserving players fails to be a part of national team because of the current manual record system. Most players do not get a chance to be highlighted by selectors due to this system. An estimated budget of PCB is Rs.15 billion but still our audience is never satisfied by the selection criteria and there are complains of unfit players. Current system is not capable for many youngsters to pursue their passion. They are not facilitated properly at an early stage. 

2.	Proposed Solution:
Our goal is to help PCB spend money rightly on the truly deserving and talented candidates from all over Pakistan by providing them detailed stats of the players (like games played, wins, draws, win %, Innings played in, Scores/Figures in each innings, Runs, Fours, Sixes, Outs (with breakdown of all kinds of dismissal), Wickets taken, net run rate and more. Ex cricketers and coaches who are even at their homes can make and upload tutorials that will help young talent. Our Web app will have features like Player account, Coach account, Umpire account, Teams account, Tournament organizers account, Match recording tool, Match summary tool, New tournament, Marking ground location via google map, tournament summary tool, Records and stats of tournament dashboard, Records and stats of team dashboard, Records and stats of players dashboard, Upcoming events, Newsfeed, Messenger.

3.	Tools and technology:
•	Logo Design: Adobe photoshop, Canva.
•	Frontend: Angular and bootstrap (CSS).
•	Backend: DJANGO framework with PYTHON (data analysis using PANDAS, NUMPY and MATPLOTLIB).
•	Web Server: DJINX.
•	Database: MONGODB.

4.	Aims and objectives:
1.	Easy interaction with cricketing authorities.
2.	Merit-based selection of young cricketers.
3.	A guide for a cricketer to make his way to Pakistan Cricket Team.
4.	Complete database and record of talented players by their ranks and detailed stats.
